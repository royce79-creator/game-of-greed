# Game of Greed
This game is al about rolling dice that accumulate values to equate to points vlaues. This being said there are about six dice that will allow a player to get more points, if they end up not getting a roll with any numbers that correlate with a higher point values. This project shows some algorithm work that tests out whether or not the banker, calculate, and roll dice functionality work.

## Challenge
The challenge that we were given was to make logic for the game to pass theses tests that were given. In order to do so we edned up first approaching the problems and seeing if the tests in the folder pass based on rhe banking, game logic, and game loop make sense.

## Approach & Efficiency
When going about figuring out the problem domain, there was going through an iterative approach that would cycle through the rolls and compute an actual score for the player. The Big O for time was a linear amount that depnded on user input. For space it was using iterative loops to help with getting the equation processed.

## API
During this lab I did reach out to multiple sources like Alex, Eddie, Brandon, Clarissa, and Victor. I havea friend that also works in the industry that reviewed my code and helped with cleaning it up.
